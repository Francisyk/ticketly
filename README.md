## What Is Ticketly?
### Ticketly is a ticket-selling website simulation designed to recreate the core experience of purchasing event tickets online.
### Users can explore events, check ticket availability, and simulate purchases in real time, all within an interface designed to feel elegant, intuitive, and contemporary.
### The main goal of the project is to showcase how JavaScript adds logic and interactivity to a static layout, turning it into a functional and engaging web application.

## Project Overview: 
### The application is divided into two main parts:
#### Events Landing Page: A visually refined showcase of available events, featuring images, titles and dates in a clean and modern layout.
#### Ticket Purchase & Availability System: An interactive section where users can select tickets, simulate purchases, and see availability update dynamically based on their actions.

## Technologies Used:
### This project was developed using the following web technologies:
#### HTML: The structural foundation of the website, ensuring semantic organization and accessibility.
#### CSS: Responsible for the visual identity; a charming, chic, and modern design with attention to layout, colors, and overall aesthetics.
#### JavaScript: The heart of the project, handling ticket logic, availability control, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.

## NOTES:
### This is a _fictional_ project created for learning purposes, focused on practicing front-end fundamentals and simulating real-world website behavior. Ticketly was built to strengthen skills in JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and interface design, while maintaining a strong emphasis on user experience and visual refinement.
